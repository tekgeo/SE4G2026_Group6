# Parasole - Backend

Flask REST API server for the Parasole urban heat monitoring system.
Covers Milan (Italy) and Mexico City (Mexico), tracking temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation.

## Project structure

```

├── app.py                # Flask server — all REST endpoints
├── db_config.py          # Database connection and credentials loader
├── seed_db.py            # Creates the database schema (run once)
├── meteostat_client.py   # Wrapper for the 4 Meteostat API calls
├── ingestion.py          # Lazy-loading, data cleaning, and persistence
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies

```

---

## First-time setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure credentials

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` in any text editor and fill in your values:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=parasole_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password

RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key
RAPIDAPI_HOST=meteostat.p.rapidapi.com
```

> `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` and will never be pushed to the repository.
> Never paste real credentials into `.env.example` — that file is shared with the team.

### 3. Create the database

```bash
createdb parasole_db
```

### 4. Create the schema

```bash
python seed_db.py
```

This creates the `cities`, `weather_stations`, and `hourly_observations` tables,
enables the PostGIS extension, and seeds Milan and Mexico City. Run it only once.

### 5. Start the server

```bash
python app.py
```

The server starts at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/cities` | List of monitored cities |
| GET | `/api/v1/stations?name=Milan` | Weather stations for a city |
| GET | `/api/v1/weather?station_id=…&start_date=…&end_date=…` | Hourly observations (with lazy-load from Meteostat on cache miss) |
| GET | `/api/v1/heat-stress?station_id=…&start_date=…&end_date=…` | Critical heat stress hours (UC4) |
| GET | `/api/v1/stations/nearby?lat=…&lon=…` | Stations within 50 km via Meteostat |
| GET | `/api/v1/stations/<id>/normals` | 30-year climate normals for a station |
| POST | `/api/v1/stations/register` | Register a new weather station |

All endpoints return `application/json`. Dates use ISO 8601 UTC format.

### HTTP status codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 200 | OK — payload returned |
| 400 | Bad request — missing or malformed parameters |
| 404 | Not found — city, station, or date range does not exist |
| 503 | Service unavailable — Meteostat API quota exhausted or network failure |

## How lazy-loading works

When the dashboard requests weather data, `ingestion.py` checks the local
PostgreSQL database first. If the data is already cached, it is returned
immediately (target: under 2 seconds). If data is missing, the backend fetches
it from the Meteostat API, cleans it with Pandas (linear interpolation for gaps
up to 3 consecutive hours), stores it for future requests, and returns it.

Date ranges longer than 30 days are automatically split into chunks internally —
the Meteostat API accepts a maximum of 30 days per call. This is transparent to
the caller.

---

## Quick example (from the Jupyter dashboard)

```python
import requests

BASE = "http://localhost:5000/api/v1"

# Get all stations in Milan
stations = requests.get(f"{BASE}/stations", params={"name": "Milan"}).json()

# Fetch hourly observations — lazy-loads from Meteostat if not cached
data = requests.get(f"{BASE}/weather", params={
    "station_id": stations[0]["station_id"],
    "start_date": "2026-06-01",
    "end_date":   "2026-06-07",
}).json()

# Check heat stress hours
stress = requests.get(f"{BASE}/heat-stress", params={
    "station_id":         stations[0]["station_id"],
    "start_date":         "2026-06-01",
    "end_date":           "2026-06-07",
    "temp_threshold":     35,
    "humidity_threshold": 70,
}).json()

print(f"Critical hours: {stress['critical_hours']}")
```

# Parasole Dashboard (Jupyter Notebook)

The dashboard is the presentation layer. It connects to the Flask backend over HTTP and visualizes the data on an interactive map, charts, and a heat-stress alert panel. It never touches the database or Meteostat directly.

## Prerequisites
The backend must be running before launching the dashboard. Make sure you have completed the backend setup above and that python app.py is running on http://localhost:5000.

## Running the dashboard
-Open parasole_dashboard.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
-Run all cells.
-The "Backend check" cell confirms the connection by listing the cities and stations.

## How to use it
-Select a city to see the station map (with a temperature heatmap) and the city-wide alert banner.
-Select a station to see its temperature, humidity, and precipitation charts, plus its heat-stress alerts.
-Adjust the temperature and humidity threshold sliders to change what counts as a critical hour. The charts update automatically.
-Click "Export Alert Report" to download a CSV of the critical periods for the selected station.

## Notes for teammates

- The backend must be running before launching the Jupyter dashboard.
- Each team member needs their own `.env` file with their own database credentials.
- The RapidAPI free plan allows **500 requests per month**. The lazy-loading cache
  is designed to minimise API calls — always request data through the backend, never
  call Meteostat directly from the notebook.
- If the server returns 503, the monthly quota has been exceeded. The dashboard
  will fall back to locally cached data only.
-The dashboard reads data only through the backend REST API. The BASE_URL at the top of the notebook must match the running server (default: http://localhost:5000/api/v1).
-The first time you load data for a station, it may take a few seconds while the backend fetches it from Meteostat. After that, it is cached and loads faster.
